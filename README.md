Abstract: \
The purpose of this study is to predict whether a Costa Rican household is suffering from
poverty in order to correctly allocate funds to support struggling families. For this study it was
hypothesized that at least one of the four classification techniques being utilized (Random Forest
Decision Trees, CART Decision Tree, C5.0 Decision Tree, and k-nearest neighbor [KNN]) will
result in a model that predicts an individualâ€™s poverty status index (PSI) based on demographic
characteristics. More specifically, a secondary hypothesis is that the best predictor will be the
Random Forest Decision Tree classifier, based on sensitivity being greater than 80%. The dataset
was obtained from Kaggle. The predictor variables observed in this study include: access to
cooking gas, access to trash truck facilities, number of dependents, access to sewage system, and
total number of individuals living in a household. The study determined that the best model
based on accuracy and precision was the Random Forest model, which had a precision of 74.1%
and an accuracy of 73.9%, though its sensitivity was 46.6% and no other model was above 50%.
Further research regarding the accuracy and sensitivity of the models could be evaluated using
additional predictor variables, such as education level of individuals within a given household or
location of household. \
